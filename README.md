# 😱 Scream Zones: Antwerp Edition

**"Where can you scream in peace? We found out."**

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Scream Zones** is a web-based map application that shows you where in Antwerp you can scream freely — without disturbing others or risking police attention.  
Instead of avoiding noise, we embrace it. Whether you're stressed, emotional, or just want to let it out, we got your back.

Built with data from **OpenStreetMap**, this project categorizes places in Antwerp based on how safe, echo-friendly, or risky it is to scream there.
